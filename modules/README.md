# Modules

Optional client-side modules. Add or remove module files here; they are auto-loaded via the `modules/cl_*.lua` pattern in the fxmanifest.

Current modules:
- `cl_overhead_text.lua` — renders floating text above player heads when triggered by the `pxc:showFloatingText` event.


## Known Limitations
- As of Artifact `25718` there is ongoing issues displaying text above players, CFX and the community are working on a fix
